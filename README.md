Experience Summary

This lab provided hands-on experience with building interactive UIs using React.js. We learned how components make code reusable and modular, which is essential when building modern web applications. Passing data through props allowed us to customize the component output, while useState enabled us to create interactive behavior, such as showing and hiding messages.

We found that Reactâ€™s declarative model simplifies how the UI responds to changes. Unlike traditional JavaScript where we manually update the DOM, React handles those updates automatically. Overall, this lab helped us build confidence with component-based development, state management, and JSX.
